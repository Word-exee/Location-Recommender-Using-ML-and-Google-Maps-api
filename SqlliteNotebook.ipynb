      "[['We were meeting some friends visiting from Mumbai and came across this place by chance. It was strange that we have not visited this place ever despite having been to the N block market so many times. This was a bit quiet for a Saturday afternoon.\\n\\nThe place was a welcome delight // with a courteous staff and 90’s kids music playing in the background// we instantly felt at home.\\n\\nWe ordered a platter and some grilled fish. The food was delicious and just awesome. The portions were generous and good for sharing too. Definitely a must visit. After our meal we went to look around towards the floors above. The place is perfect for a party evening. They even have a terrace which they let out for parties // I am sure it’s buzzing during the evenings // unlike the Saturday afternoon we came in.', 'Visited laid back cafe at GK1 on Sunday, 13 Aug 23 and it was one of the finest and memorable experience I had at the outlet. While the service was fabulous the food was sumptuous and the DJ just added to the overall fun quotient. Would like to thank the staff, the duty manager and the full team including DJ for making our evening such a great one', 'Amazing place to hang out in peace with light lighting and slow music and live streaming.. loved the menu options and decent pricing', 'Only reason to give 4 star is because their prices. It’s on a higher side. But once you get paas this fact, food is actually good! Also you can get 50% off from dineout offer but mind you the offer does not apply on sheesha and cocktails! Ambiance is good. I tried their burger and pizza and both were really amazing! Must try place.', 'I mean this is the most ideal place for people who wanna have a great evening/night, though this place is on the expensive side it offers high quality and standards of food, beverage and party and the atmosphere is amazing with a good crowd.\\nThank you Team Shalom for giving us an amazing experience.\\nI must say, the staffs are very friendly and helpful.'], ['Visited this cafe on a Friday night and enjoyed our time here. Good ambience and better food is always the best combination to have! The DJ playing the music was always amazing. Loved the complete vibe of the place.\\nWe sat in the upper floor outside and enjoyed the weather as well.\\nWe had ordered for the below -\\n1. Veg Mezze Platter - The platter was delicious. The falafel bullets were nice and crispy with the 3 dips.\\n2. Asparagus Tempura Sushi - It was very palatable. Enjoyed the sushi. Would surely recommend it.\\n3. Spicy Farm Fresh pizza - It was scrumptious and yummy. Enjoyed the pizza.\\n\\nApart from these also had the hookah and it was nice.\\nAll in all, enjoyed the food and the vibe of the cafe. Do visit.', 'We loved the location and ambience of the cafe! It was love at first sight, but did not last long.. When we reached it was not crowded and we chose a nice corner place in rooftop..\\nAfter we got our food and drinks, and started eating, we were requested to shift to another table because they wanted the tables for a large group.. the couple on the next table was also asked the same..though they asked nicely and helped us getting shifted, but it was unprofessional..\\nWe understand it is open rooftop, but there were too many houseflies..\\nAlso, they got wrong order..changed it after some time..Service is a bit on slower side..\\nWe found the place somewhat okayish..fine for one time visit..\\nHowever, all the problems are avoidable and this place has definitely a great potential for drawing crowd..!!', 'The place is photogenic, the food was awesome we ordered fish sticks and it was great, the place has rooftop seating which was outstanding. However when it comes to hukkah the place is just hyped, overpriced and overrated. They are selling hookah for 4k that too same flavours but the hookah is different which didn’t made sense to me, personally for me the sheesha brand, size and shape doesn’t matters, what matters is how good is the flow and make of the hookah is in experience. Morover the flavours we asked them to make were not proper hence it has to be changed and it took another half hour and they are strict with the timings of hookah and one of waiters was siiting on a our head to pay bill and leave the hookah which left a scar on our experience even thought when they were aware we had been provided wrong hookah and making corrections caused delay. Its good for one time experience.', \"I recently visited this hidden gem, and I must say it was a delightful experience from start to finish.\\nUpon entering, you'll experience a picturesque ambiance with cozy lighting. The music was soothing, with nostalgic songs playing in the background.\\nWe had peri peri vegetable pizza and Grilled cottage cheese panini, and for beverages, we opted for cappuccino and chocolate hazelnut shake. Both the pizza and panini left a flavorful impression, and the beverages were equally toothsome and refreshing.The attentive staff made our dining experience even more satisfying. Additionally, the restaurant offers open rooftop seating with beautiful decor.\\nIn conclusion, 1 Oak provides a cozy and welcoming ambiance, along with delicious food and great service.\", 'Everything in the food menu is yum! The highlight is that each of the dish is super light and delicious. Shoutout to 1 Oak for customising my white sauce veggie pasta and adding shredded chicken pieces! Highly recommended!\\nOne suggestion - We had to ask for water refill multiple times. Also, it was hard to get the waiter’s attention.'], ['Awesome atmosphere and foods .\\n\\nThey have good spread of food and drinks.\\nService is fabulous and they have veri big screen so we have enjoyed a lot while watching India vs SA cricket match on giant screen.\\n\\nApart from that Mr.Gaurav (Manager) is very Generous and up to the marks on thier services and ensuring guests have enjoyed the most while helping to ordering foods and drinks etc.\\n\\nA big five stars 🤩🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠', 'Place was awsome no doubt….but price is actually over, not just a bit high but everything is over price here according to quantity….who spent Rs.1750 for single hukkah???? i travell a lot but never seen this price for just a hukkah🙄', 'I personally love this place and delicious food .

There I ate different types of donuts. I like all donuts. But there was plenty of sugar in the donuts and in the waffle.They made this by looking at Dunkin Donuts. If Mad over donuts will do anything unique, it would be good to tell you. Everything is conceptualized by looking at Dunkin Donuts. I found mistake, Their food prices are very high and the taste is good, But sugar is very rich in donuts and waffles. In this epidemic of coronavirus, your bakery kitchen staff did not wear masks on the mouth, The cape was not even worn on the head. You don't know that much if you are in the kitchen and you will not do this without a cape and without gloves and without a mask, you should not do this, you know it is necessary to clean the kitchen, Whether it is a restaurant kitchen or a hotel kitchen, you should work cleanly inside the kitchen. If you feed in Coronavirus like this, it will not be good. I have put a photo for all of you in the review, you all will definitely see. And tell the staff to talk to the customers well.
