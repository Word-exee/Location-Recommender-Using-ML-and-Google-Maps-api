Pretty much all the expected omelettes,  idli dosa, puri chola and other options were there .. The salad counter had seeds, nuts missing though they were promptly provided upon request.\n\nThe coffee tasted sub par...actually not worth it....I was quite surprised to find out that in plant based milk they offered only soy milk even though oat milk and almond are so commonly available at good cafes.\n\nThe BF buffet was one can say economical......but I expected more .....', '&&&&&', ""I recently dined at your restaurant, and I must express my utmost satisfaction with both the delectable food and impeccable service.

However not sure what makes this place popular amongst influencers.\nA tabloid like menu which also states the history of this place. The only thing which I liked about this is the demeanor of the staff. Doesn't deserve the hype it has gotten, definitely not for food.\n\nWe ordered their signature dish- railway cutlets and I strongly feel that the original cutlets served at the railways taste better!\n\nAlso mushroom soup was average.\n\nMutton and rice was ordered too which failed to impress"", '&&&&&', ""Good food. Good ambience. Nice coffee. The service is allright.  There's mosquitoes on the outside area specially at night.
