While the complex boasts a variety of delightful dining options that cater to diverse tastes, the state of the washrooms leaves much to be desired.Let's start with the positive aspects. The range of restaurants available within the complex is impressive, offering everything from upscale cafe to casual eatery . Whether you're craving Italian or continental cuisine, there's something for everyone here. The ambiance of these dining venues is inviting, and the quality of the food consistently exceeds expectations.However, my enthusiasm for the culinary offerings is dampened by the deplorable condition of the washrooms. It's evident that cleanliness and hygiene are not priorities in this area. On numerous occasions, I've encountered filthy facilities, with overflowing trash bins, clogged toilets, and unpleasant odors permeating the air. The lack of maintenance is not only unsightly but also poses potential health hazards to patrons.As someone who values cleanliness and sanitation, I find it unacceptable that such a reputable shopping complex neglects this fundamental aspect of customer experience. It's disheartening to witness the stark contrast between the excellence of the dining establishments and the appalling state of the washrooms.In conclusion, while I appreciate the efforts put into curating an exceptional dining scene, the management must address the glaring issue of washroom cleanliness. Failure to do so not only tarnishes the reputation of Santushti complex but also the cafe and restaurant compromises the well-being of its patrons. I sincerely hope that steps will be taken to rectify this matter promptly."", '&&&&&', 'A quiet place, away from the hustle bustle of the usual Delhi‚Äôs shopping complexes and markets.This place is a must visit for those who enjoy some private shopping and leisure time.

Located in front of Taj Palace, this place is indeed a coffee lover's heaven. They have open sitting area and a very peaceful environment to enjoy your coffee and explore your inner thoughts. Been here on a cloudy afternoon and the place was beautiful.\nIts a pet friendly place and you can meet lots of cats here too.\nService was good and quick. The only concern is that Bathroom should be maintained well."", '&&&&&', 'CCD Always good to hve a day with cafe coffee..Great taste as always....Nice place where you can sip a cup of amazing coffee with friends or even alone..Service is good..Good customer service.\xa0near taj place  Chanakyapuri new delhi', '&&&&&', ""Amazing ambience and I have been visiting this CCD for years now. Prefect place for a evening get away, feeling blissful with open sitting fresh air and treeeeees.....\nRecently I saw a specially abeled staff member and her smile and gesture made my day. However, after a while I got really upset seeing the way other staff members behaved with her. There was a guy (his tag said Ram Rathi) he was talking to her so badly, instructing her to clean with sheer tone of disrespect and insult. He asked her to stand at the back of cafe when she stood at the door so that she doesn't greet customers. I am so furious with the management of this cafe who are tolerating such behaviors. It is so shameful to see someone treating an equal with such disrespect. This made my years of happy experience really felt awful today. I wish businesses take more effort in educating their people about basic manners and code of conduct.\nI really wish the girl working there more power and may her smile always stays intact."", '&&&&&', 'The place has a different vibe altogether.\nRight into the beautiful surroundings of the clean embassy area, this place is a must visit.\n\nThe outside sitting is well maintained.\n\nOne star deducted for no proper washrooms as such a place would demand.', '&&&&&', 'Nested in a quiet place opposite hotel Taj Palace, the natural picturesque of the location is simply amazing.', '&&&&&']",ChIJx7e5opsdDTkRpiuHpoeb0qE,1.0
